The requirements for A01 were to design a circuit in which at least 3 LEDs blink
independently. The intention for this particular design was to have the blinking
occur at attenuated random time intervals that would constantly change, providing
an arrythmic seizure-inducing lightshow.
            </p><p>
To determine the appropriate resistor values, first the LED DATASHEET provided by
ELEGOO was used to find the operational VOLTAGE across the different LED types.
Using the nominal current of 20mA, the required resistance was calculated using
Ohm's law. The closest available resistor in the kit was then chosen, and the
current checked once again using Ohm's law.

  A01 HCDE439 WIN20 // DEREK R

  3 LEDs go blinky at independent, random intervals.
  Interval changes between each change of state.
  Range for random interval can be manipulated,
  effecting timing for all LEDs.
