Except it'll be two buttons, and the LED is an RGB LED so technically it's three
LEDs bundled into one, and we're going to make a PARTY LIGHT. One button is designed
to adjust between two brightness levels while the other cycles through the magical
color series RYGCBM. A million for-loops and many changes of state will allow us to keep
this party going all night.
            </p>
            <p>
By recommendation of ELEGOO in their RGB LED TUTORIAL and by confirmation of
hard math and science, 220 ohm resistors are used for the RGB LED. For the buttons,
instead of using the regular digitalRead INPUT with an external pulldown resistor,
the INPUT_PULLUP mode is implemented for neat and tidy circuitry in the form of
two less resistors and a bonus educational opportunity. The INPUT_PULLUP setting
utilizes a 20k ohm resistor inside the Arduino to default the voltage to a HIGH
setting, allowing an external switch to pull the signal low by shorting to ground.
The 20k ohm resistor throttles the current at a mega safe level of 0.025 mA or basically nothing,
saving your precious electrons for components that actually need them.

/*
  A02 HCDE439 WIN20 // DEREK R // ITS A MOOD-RING?

  Exhibit incredibly advanced interpretation of natural phenomena
  by controlling an LED using analogRead() and an analog input pin.
  The heart of the circuit is a thermistor which translates the magic
  of the human touch to the red&blue LEDs in an RGB LED. Additionally,
  a simple voltage divider sets the reference voltage for analogRead()
  and a potentiometer is included in the thermistor circuit to allow
  for calibration of the system.

  Note that higher analogRead values correlate with lower temperatures.
